<p>
    One of my favorite books is the "Mahabharatham," an epic narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes. It's a timeless piece of literature with profound teachings and stories.

<p>
    One of my all-time favorite movies is "Titanic." Directed by James Cameron, this epic romance and disaster film tells the compelling story of Jack and Rose, two passengers on the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. The film beautifully captures the emotions, struggles, and ultimately, the tragic fate of the ship. The breathtaking visuals, memorable soundtrack, and outstanding performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make it a timeless classic.
